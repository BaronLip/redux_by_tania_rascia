# redux_by_tania_rascia

`index.js`
The terminology of "external", "local", and "assets" is perfect. I struggled with what terms to use while organizing imports on my own. "Local" may also work as "internal" in my mind.

## QUESTIONS

1. Why can a reducer function not be in ES6 syntax?
2. ~ What is the difference between a component and a page folders? ~
   * In this example:
     * Components folder files do not connect to Redux store. 
     * Pages folder files do connect to Redux store.
3. In `Post.js`, what is `{post.body.substring(0, 100)}` ?
4. What is the syntax for the connect() statement?
5. PostPage.js, What is `useEffect()` from React?
6. PostPage.js, How is dispatch passed a prop?
